The IEEE Student Branch at The University of Texas at Austin would not exist without the generous support of corporate partners. We’re always pleased to develop new relationships with our electrical engineering counterparts in the professional world. Need internship or job positions filled? Supporting a Branch event is a great way to do it! For more information about ways your company can work with the Branch, please refer to our <a href="https://ieee.ece.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IEEECorporate2015-2016-Haley.pdf">2015 – 2016 Corporate Package</a>.
