## Branch Information

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
Founded in 1947, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Student Branch at The University of Texas at Austin is a student-run organization which promotes the interests of undergraduate and graduate electrical/computer engineering students on and off-campus. We host service events, coordinate opportunities to meet with corporate representatives, and facilitate networking between fellow electrical and computer engineers.

IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.) is a non-profit, technical professional association of more than 380,000 individual members in 150 countries. Through its members, the IEEE is a leading authority in technical areas ranging from computer engineering, biomedical technology and telecommunications, to electric power, aerospace and consumer electronics. The IEEE Student Branch at The University of Texas at Austin is a member of the Central Texas Section in Region 5 of the international IEEE organization.

Most Branch activities do not require you to be a Branch member. However, we strongly encourage you to officially join the Branch. You may become a member of the student branch by paying $10 dues to any officer. Paid members will receive a membership T-shirt, can vote in yearly officer elections, and can accrue points towards becoming a SPARK member by attending meetings and student branch events.

You may also join the Branch through the international IEEE organization as a student member. If you join the international organization, send us your UT EID and membership number. Join the international IEEE by registering at its membership page. Make sure to select “Univ of Texas-Austin” as your institution. At this time, membership in the international organization costs $32 per calendar year.

In order to recognize committed members of IEEE, we have instituted the SPARK membership program, a further membership tier that can be achieved by attending IEEE student branch meetings and events. SPARK members will have their resumes entered into the IEEE resume book, can run in officer elections, and more.

A full breakdown of the IEEE student branch membership program can be accessed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4O5n9XH-ucMYmn88H-CEhjxLPQbjKUSxGbcgwb6gto/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

If your organization is interested in supporting the Branch, please refer to the Corporate Partners page for more details or contact the Corporate Director (<a href="mailto:corporate.director@ieeeut.org">corporate.director@ieeeut.org</a>).
